##  The following imports the 'features' or the variable names of the cell phone data
features <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt", stringsAsFactor = F)
##  Creates an increasing numeric vector of variables the show the mean and standard deviation; anything with mean() or std()
variables <- sort(c(grep("mean()", features$V2, value = F, fixed = T),  
                    grep("std()", features$V2, value = F, fixed = T)))
featurenames <- features[variables,]$V2  	##  Creates a list from the 'features' matching the indices from 'variables'
											##  To be later used to name the final datasets
											
##  The following imports the specific variables according to the indices created by the 'variables' vector
xtrain <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt")[variables]
xtest <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt")[variables]
## 	Names the columns of the raw data using the list created in 'featurenames'
names(xtrain) <- featurenames
names(xtest) <- featurenames

##  The following combines the train-sets and the test-sets separately; then together creating one large set : oneSet
trainSet <- data.frame(trainSubject, ytrain, xtrain)
testSet <- data.frame(testSubject, ytest, xtest)
oneSet <<- rbind(trainSet, testSet)
oneSet$Activity <- levels(oneSet$Activity)[oneSet$Activity]		##  recode() makes the Activity column factors; this returns it to characters

##  The following makes the column names of oneSet more tidy
oSnames <- names(oneSet)				## Creates a vector of the names of the column
oSnames <- gsub("[.]", "", oSnames)		## Takes all the periods out of the vector
names(oneSet) <- oSnames				## Renames 'oneSet's columns from the tidy name vector (oSnames)

##  This part creates a new data set that shows the average(mean) of every variable grouped by 'Subjects' and their corresponding 'Activity'
molten = melt(oneSet, id = c("Subject", "Activity"))  ##  Collapses 'oneSet' to a long, simplified data set sorted by 'Subject' & 'Activity'
names(molten) <- c("Subject", "Activity", "Variable", "Value")  ## This step is necessary but I just renamed the collapsed dataset columns
##  The final part reforms the data row-wise by 'Subject' and 'Activity' then column-wise by the 'Variables', then takes the mean according to ##  the group
tidyData <<- dcast(molten, formula = Subject + Activity ~ Variable, value.var = "Value", mean)
write.table(tidyData, file = readline(prompt = "file name? (include extension) >"))
View(tidyData)  ##  This brings up the 'tidyData' in the preview window
